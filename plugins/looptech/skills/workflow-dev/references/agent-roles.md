# Agent roles — classes, never model slugs

The plugin knows **roles**. Model IDs belong in the Project Profile (`agents:`) or,
failing that, in whatever catalog the current host exposes. Never write a vendor
slug (a branded model name) into a skill.

## Roles

| Role | Class | When | What to pick from the host catalog |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | `coord` | Fase 0, 1 (git), 2 (chat), Env, 7, 8, Fechamento | Session default. Do not swap. |
| `plan` | `reasoning` | Fase 1b, 2b, Fase 3 spec+plan+/goals | Highest reasoning + longest context |
| `impl` | `code` | Fase 6/6-S dev, pós-review fix, Fase 7 fix | Fastest strong coding model |
| `review` | `critique` | Review de correção (/goal + testes) | A **different** ID from `impl` on this task, if the host has one |
| `security` | `security` | Review de segurança no mesmo diff, antes do commit | Host security specialist if any; else `critique` + the security checklist |

## Resolution (Fase 0, once per session)

1. Detect the host (`host-compat.md`).
2. If `agents.<host>.<role>` exists in the Profile, use that `model` (and any
   host-native effort/thinking field next to it).
3. Else, if `agents.<role>` exists without a host key, use that.
4. Else, scan the host's installed catalog and pick by **class** (table above).
5. If the catalog has **one** model, every role inherits it. Say so:
   `"um modelo só — papéis colapsados"`.
6. If `security` has no specialist, fall back to `critique` and paste
   `security-review.md` in full. Do **not** invent a product name.

Never invent a slug. If the host rejects the resolved ID, report, fall back to
the session default, and continue the spawn.

## Profile block

Optional. Without it the workflow still runs, using steps 4–6, and warns.

```yaml
agents:
  <host>:                    # cursor | claude | codex | omp | … — only hosts you use
    reasoning: { model: <id do catálogo> }
    code:      { model: <id do catálogo> }
    critique:  { model: <id do catálogo> }   # omit → another code id, else reasoning readonly
    security:  { model: <id do catálogo> }   # omit → critique + checklist
```

On **omp**, this block is also what `looptech:omp-setup` reads to populate
its own per-agent override map — see `host-compat.md` for why that extra
step exists there and nowhere else.

`<id do catálogo>` is whatever the host lists **today**. The plugin never
suggests a default brand. `init` asks the human to map the catalog.

## Named agents (plugin `agents/`)

Spawn **by name**. Pass the resolved catalog ID as the host's model field
(Cursor: prefer the named agent; if the host ignores plugin `model: inherit`,
still spawn the name — the Profile ID is the override).

| Workflow slot | Agent name | Class | Tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fase 1b / 2b / 3 | `plan` | `reasoning` | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (readonly) |
| Impl Go | `expert-backend-go` | `code` | Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash |
| Impl Python | `expert-backend-python` | `code` | same |
| Impl React | `expert-frontend-react` | `code` | same |
| Impl Vue | `expert-frontend-vue` | `code` | same |
| UX mobile-first | `expert-frontend-pwa` | `code` | same (serialize writes with engineering) |
| UX web-first | `expert-frontend-web` | `code` | same |
| Persistência | `expert-database` | `code` | same; prod gated |
| Review de correção | `review` | `critique` | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (readonly) |
| Review de segurança / pentest defensivo | `expert-security` | `security` | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (readonly; scanners only) |

Frontend impl loads the UX agent **into the same handoff** when the area
resolves to pwa/web (one writer). Only spawn a second UX agent if the task is
UX-only.

The orchestrator never changes its own model mid-task.
